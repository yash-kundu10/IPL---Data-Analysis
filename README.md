* Take the win_by_wickets dataset and plot frequency distribution graph On x-axis - Win by Wickets on y-axis Win by Wickets margin
* Relative frequency distribution graph using the same data set win_by_wickets Hint: use normalize = True argument for pandas.Series.value_counts Instead of showing frequency show percentage of values
* Plot Cumulative relative frequency graph Use function pandas.Series.cumsum
* Find out the probability of winning a match by 6 wickets or less? Find out the probability using the cumulative relative frequency graph Draw a vertical line from 6 on x-axis till it intercepts the curve and the draw the horizontal line till it intercepts y-axis Hint: Answer is 54%
* Plot the normal distribution for win_by_wickets data. Calculate mean and standard deviation for win_by_wickets data Plot Histogram Plot Line Graph Plot Normal distribution between 1 and 10 using mean and standard deviation as calculated above
* Calculate z-score if the team wins by 35 runs. Calculate mean and standard deviation for win_by_wickets data Use win_by_runs dataset
* Calculate percentile using z-score. Use scipy.stats.norm.cdf function
